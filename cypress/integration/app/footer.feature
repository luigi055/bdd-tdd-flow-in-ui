Feature: footer component

    As a user I want to have a footer so I can see the cornerjob copyright

    Scenario: The user is able to see the footer cornerjob copyright
    Given I am on the get in touch page
    Then I can see the footer with all its elements
    And I can see the copyright "Cornerjob Â© Copyright 2021"
